# Swarm API Template
Template architecture has three fragments with three activities, which inflates from the bottom navigation bar.
Fragment favorite provides the sample code for fetching the data from the server. 

Note: you can copy the server response from the text view and use it in edittext for further URL responses.
You can use other two fragments for adding more activity.
